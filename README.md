# au-con-tool-mp3-to-m4a
 This Bash script leverages FFmpeg for batch converting MP3 files to M4A format. Users specify source and output directories as arguments, with error-checking for FFmpeg availability. The script offers a user-friendly experience, providing real-time progress updates during the conversion process.

 To use the Bash script for converting MP3 files to M4A, follow these steps:

### Ensure FFmpeg is Installed:
Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. If not, install it using your system's package manager.

### Download the Script:
Save the Bash script to a file, for example, convert_mp3_to_m4a.sh.

### Make the Script Executable:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script. Run the following command to make the script executable:

`chmod +x convert_mp3_to_m4a.sh`

### Run the Script:
Execute the script with the source directory containing your MP3 files and the output directory for M4A files as arguments:

`./convert_mp3_to_m4a.sh /path/to/source/directory /path/to/output/directory`

Replace /path/to/source/directory with the actual path to your MP3 files and /path/to/output/directory with the desired output directory.


### Monitor Progress:
The script will provide real-time updates as it converts each MP3 file to M4A. Once the process is complete, a message will indicate the successful conversion.

By following these steps, you can easily convert multiple MP3 files to M4A using the provided Bash script.
